# Async Pioneer AV amp

My VSX-924 AV amp works with the original Home Assistant Pioneer driver for a few hours, a day or two at max only. After that it freezes, and only a power off/on cycle makes it useable again.
This is because that driver creates a new telnet connection to the amp for every update, it queries the required info, and then closes the connection. The telnet software in the amp firmware probably has memory leak, that might be the reason for this freeze after a few thousands of telnet connections.

No firmware updates available for this amp anymore, so I re-wrote the driver in an async workflow: it creates a single connection and listens to the replies from the amp in an endless loop.
The idea is probably right, because my amp hardly freezes now. As a bonus, it was also possible to capture the display-content of the amp.

I recommend the [Mini Media Player](https://github.com/kalkih/mini-media-player) from kalkih as a nice UI for the amp.

## Install

1. Download and copy [media_player.py](https://github.com/realthk/asyncpioneer/blob/master/media_player.py) and [__init__.py](https://github.com/realthk/asyncpioneer/blob/master/__init__.py)into `config/custom_components/asyncpioneer` directory.

2. Add a reference to this inside your `configuration.yaml`:

  ```yaml
media_player:
  - platform: asyncpioneer
    host: 192.168.8.121
    port: 8102

  ```

## Options
**serial_bridge**:
If set to `true`, a 100ms delay will be added between sequential telnet commands.  This pause is necessary for those connecting connecting to their amp with an RS-232 to Ethernet bridge.  Without the delay, the connection to the amp becomes unreliable and eventually fails. Default value, if not specified in `configuration.yaml`, is `false`.

**last_radio_station**:
If not set, "next track" button in radio tuner mode will simply send "next station" command to the amp, which is not convenient, if you only have a few stations stored in the amp's memory.
If this is set to eg. "B03", then sending a "next track" command when listening to "B03" will result in a "select A01 station" command. Likewise, a "previous track" on "A01" results in "select B03 station".

**radio_stations**:
You can name the stored stations here, because not every radio use RDS. Dictionary format.

**inputs**:
Mapping between input numbers and human readable names. Usually this mapping is automatically discovered by driver at startup. Use this section only if the amp doesn't support input names discovery or you want to override input names provided by amp. No discovery performed if this section is present in the configuration. The format for this section is standard dictionary. Please note that input numbers should be enclosed in parentheses.

**disabled_sources**:
A simple list to disable unwanted input sources, to make the source selector list shorter.

**zones**:
Zone2 or HDZone can be switched on here. It creates another instance of media_player with "\_zone2" or "\_hdzone" added to the name. Eq. if the main device is _media_player.pioneer_avr_, zone 2 will be named as _media_player.pioneer_avr_zone2_

  ```yaml
    zones:
      - zone: "Zone2"
        name: "Zone 2"
  ```
(name: can be whatever, not in use yet)

## Services
**pioneer_select_speaker**:

Select output speaker "A", "B" or "A+B"

  ```yaml
  - service: media_player.pioneer_select_speaker
    data:
      entity_id: media_player.pioneer_avr
      speaker: "A+B"
  ```

**pioneer_select_hdmi_out**:

  ```yaml
  - service: media_player.pioneer_select_hdmi_out

      entity_id: media_player.pioneer_avr
      hdmi_out: "1+2 ON"
  ```
where possible values for hdmi_out:

- "1+2 ON"

**pioneer_select_speaker_config**:

With this service call, it is possible to change  this config from a Home Assistant automation.

  - service: media_player.pioneer_select_speaker_config
    data:
      entity_id: media_player.pioneer_avr
      speaker_config: "Height"
